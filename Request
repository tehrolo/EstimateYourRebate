Estimate Your Rebate
2 radials: 1 that says Buyer and one that says Seller
The input box below the radial becomes available, and says Purchase Price or Selling Price
under the input box depending on the radial that was selected.
A slide bar that has Commission Rate under it, and is adjustable from 3-10%
A display that gives an Estimated Rebate

Rebate Math (that happens in the background)
Purchase Price * Commission Rate = Gross Commission Income (GCI)
GCI – 7% (Franchise Fee) = Brokerage Split
Brokerage Split – 5% = Net Income
Net Income * 40% = Estimated Rebate
(Being able to adjust settings/change the brokerage split % would be useful if I decide use a different
commission schedule)

A check box with a popup question after the Estimated Rebate “Would you like to donate a portion this
rebate?”
If they check the box, another display pops up showing “Estimated Rebate” &amp; “Estimated Donation”
Estimated Rebate = Net Income * 25%
Estimated Donation = Net Income * 15*

After they input the data (Purchase Price and Commission Rate), a pie chart fills in on the right-hand side
of the “Calculator”.
Its title being “Where Commission Goes” and Labels being:
Franchise Fee (Pie portion visible, but the dollar amount and % not being displayed)
Brokerage Split (Pie portion visible, but the dollar amount and % not being displayed)
Agent Commission (Pie Portion visible and dollar amount displayed)
Estimated Rebate (Pie Portion visible and dollar amount displayed)

Having a compare function where you have two calculators and pie charts visible to make adjustments
and comparisons would be nice.

The 2 nd /3 rd Pie chart (depending on the donation check box/comparison option) would have one
additional section:
Estimated Donation (Pie Portion visible and dollar amount displayed)

Referral Rebate (If I cannot work with the client and have to refer them calculator)
2 radials: 1 that says Buyer and one that says Seller
The input box below the radial becomes available, and says Purchase Price or Selling Price
under the input box depending on the radial that was selected.
A slide bar that has Commission Rate under it, and is adjustable from 3-10%
A display that gives an Estimated Referral Rebate

Rebate Math (that happens in the background)
Purchase Price * Commission Rate = Gross Commission Income (GCI)
GCI – 7% (Franchise Fee) = GCI Reduced Franchise Fee
GCI Reduced Franchise Fee * 25% = Referral Commission
Referral Commission – 5% = Net Income
Net Income * 100% = Estimated Referral Rebate
(Being able to adjust settings/change the brokerage split % would be useful if I decide use a different
commission schedule)

A check box with a popup question after the Estimated Referral Rebate “Would you like to donate this
rebate?”
If they check the box, another display pops up showing “Estimated Donation”
Estimated Donation = Estimated Referral Rebate * 100%

After they input the data (Purchase Price and Commission Rate), a pie chart fills in on the right-hand side
of the “Calculator”.

Its title being “Where Commission Goes” and Labels being:
Franchise Fee (Pie portion visible, but the dollar amount and % not being displayed)
Referring Brokerage Split (Pie portion visible, but the amount and % not being displayed)
Referring Agents Commission / Estimated Referral Rebate (Pie Portion visible and dollar amount
displayed)
Agents Commission (Pie portion visible, but the amount and % not being displayed)
Brokerage Split (Pie portion visible, but the amount and % not being displayed)
The referree Agent/Broker split is unknow to me, however 60/40 is a good base line, and a blurb should
be put in that it is just an estimate.

Having a compare function where you have two calculators and pie charts visible to make adjustments
and comparisons would be nice.
